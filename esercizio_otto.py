# Rock Paper Scissors

# Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
# (Hint: Ask for player plays (using input), compare them,
# print out a message of congratulations to the winner,
# and ask if the players want to start a new game)

# Remember the rules:

#    Rock beats scissors
#    Scissors beats paper
#    Paper beats rock
